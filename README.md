# MeditateWithEinaudi
Day 3 of challenge to build 30 vanilla JS projects over 30 days (meditation app with timer, video and music)

A vanilla JS project with three primary files (index.html, index.js and style.css), as well as svg files for the play and pause
buttons and the timer effect. Videos (free from pixabay) uses in the background.

Times can be updated to changed to adjust the meditation timeframes offered, with alternative videos and music possible
to change also.

# Disclaimer

No copyright infringement intended with this app. I planned to create a meditation app for day 3, and there was no music more
soothing that I could think of than Einaudi, and therefore this pays homage. Please go buy his music from iTunes, stream 
it on Spotify or go see him in concert.
